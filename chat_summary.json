The user was given the choices of \"Small\" or \"Large\" for size and \"Center\" or \"Top corner\" for positioning. \n\nSubsequently, the AI provided a checklist of additional features for the app, indicating various elements such as adding an email input field and including a send button. The user requested to add an email form for Santa, and the AI confirmed, \"Sure, I will add an email form for Santa.\" The user was again presented with questions about the email form design and information to be collected, offering options related to recipient details and design style. \n\nContinuing, the conversation included another checklist where the user was offered features like a combo training feature for hadoken moves and animations for the hadoken button press. The AI acknowledged adding a hadoken button as per the user's request and asked for further details by saying, \"Can you describe the project a bit more?\" This led to a structured dialog where various options and implementations were discussed to enhance the app's functionality.",
